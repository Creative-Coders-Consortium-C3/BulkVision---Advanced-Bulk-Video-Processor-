   - The script will automatically prompt you to mount your Google Drive
   - Accept the authorization request

3. **Prepare Your Files**:
   - Create these folders in your Google Drive:
     - `/MyDrive/Uploader Video` (for input videos)
     - `/MyDrive/output folder` (for processed videos)
   - Place your watermark image at `/MyDrive/c3.png`

## üíª Usage Guide

1. **Configure Processing Settings**:
   - **Speed**: Adjust video playback speed (0.5x to 2.0x)
   - **Pitch**: Modify audio pitch (0.5x to 2.0x)
   - **Video Enhancement**:
     - Brightness (-1.0 to 1.0)
     - Contrast (0.0 to 2.0)
     - Saturation (0.0 to 2.0)
   - **Audio**: Volume boost (-20dB to +20dB)
   - **Watermark Options**:
     - Position selection
     - Flip toggles for video and watermark

2. **Start Processing**:
   - Click the "Process Videos" button
   - Monitor progress through the progress bar
   - Check the log file for detailed processing information

## üìä Output

- Processed videos are saved with 'processed_' prefix
- Output videos maintain high quality using H.264 NVIDIA encoding
- Original metadata is stripped for privacy
- Detailed logs are generated for troubleshooting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Requires Google Colab with GPU runtime for optimal performance
- Input videos must be in common formats (mp4, avi, mov, mkv)
- Watermark must be in PNG format
- Processing speed depends on:
  - Video file sizes
  - Selected enhancement options
  - Google Colab's GPU availability

## üîç Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **GPU Not Available**:
   - Change runtime type to GPU in Colab
   - Wait for GPU availability if resources are busy

2. **File Not Found Errors**:
   - Verify Google Drive paths
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure proper Drive mounting

3. **Processing Errors**:
   - Check video file format compatibility
   - Verify watermark file existence and format
   - Review log file for specific error messages

## üìù Logging

The script maintains detailed logs including:
- Processing start and completion times
- FFmpeg command details
- Error messages and warnings
- Processing status for each video
